# Chapter 5 Part 2 of DOET

Chapter 5 of DOET continues the thought about errors from the previous part of chapter 5, focusing more on examples/case studies. For example Toyota has the workers report problems and sometimes stops the entire assembly line in order to get to the bottom of the problem. Another error proofing method is poka-yoka also used in Toyota where it adds simple fixes to the operations until they are correct. 

He also talks about events in hindsight seeming logical while foresight making it difficult. During an incident, there are usually never clear clues with the high workload, high emotional, and high stress levels. 

Rather than designing for success, it is important to design for error since people are prone to making mistakes. Since machines can't understand us, we often design things for them, leading for tragic accidents. He talks about rather than blaming everything for a simple error, we should understand the root cause of the error of the design and make sure it passes the common sense check. Instead of treating things as an error, help guide the person through the action properly. 

After talking a lot about errors, he talks about constraints to prevent errors from happening. An example of this is making container openings have different sizes and shapes and making fluids different colors so they are easily distinguishable. These techniques are also used in hospitals and industry. 

The undo tool (my favorite) is the best way to minimize the errors by reversing the error itself. Even if it is only for digital use, it is a big time saver. Confirmation screens are good in order to make sure that random clicking doesn't make you delete all of your files. While it is annoying, it is because the person focuses on the process rather than the object they are controlling the fate of. 

At the end of the day, we can't always blame design but rather the person themself. Even the most competent people become dogshit if they aren't feeling well, leading to laws disencouraging you from drinking and driving for example. 

Automation is also getting smarter with AI on the rise. Before machines can only go beep boop but now they can generate whole ass AI slop art and drive you around (with risks of course). While it is cool and all, too much automation is never good as if automation fails, what do you even do? 

That's why humans will not be replaced as eventually people will have to fix the problems machines can't since machines can only do what they are programmed to do. What I got from this is that we should make humans deal with the things they are good at and the machines the thing they are good at so that way we can rely on each other. I agree with this sentiment because AI should not be anywhere near a pencil and we shouldn't need to clean our house when a Roomba can do it for us. Basically leave the creative stuff to us and the boring repetitive stuff to the robots, not the other way around. Might just be artist bias though lol.
