# Chapter 4 Part 1 of DOET

“Knowledge in the world includes perceived affordances and signifiers, the mappings between the parts that appear to be controls or places to manipulate and the resulting actions, and the physical constraints that limit what can be done. Knowledge in the head includes conceptual models; cultural, semantic, and logical constraints on behavior; and analogies between the current situation and previous experiences with other situations.” (pg 123)
Chapter focuses on knowledge of the world, how designers can provide key info that allow people to know what to do even if it is unfamiliar
For example a lego motorcycle has 15 pieces that are constructed well enough that even an adult can put it together. It has physical constraints that limit the ways you can place pieces, leading to effective construction
Combining cultural, semantic, and logical constraints with physical one, it’s possible to build the motorcycle without any instructions or assistance

### Four Kinds of Constraints: Physical, Cultural, Semantic, and Logical (pg 125) 

Physical constraints are what limit possible operations like how a square cannot fit into a circle hole and vice versa
Effective and useful if easy to see and interpret 
A bad example is a battery, in which you cannot see which end the battery goes to fit into the slots. 
A way to make it so orientation doesn’t matter is a solution
Can design shape of battery so it only fits one way which most plug in components do this with shapes, notches, and protrusions 
Inelegant design persists because of the legacy problem. The legacy problem is the existing standard that a lot of designs use such as batteries always being cylinder shaped. 

### Cultural constraints (pg 128) 

“Each culture has a set of allowable actions for social situations.” (pg 128)
Eg. We know how to behave in a restaurant without being in one
This is why we feel helpless when confronting people of unfamiliar cultures
Cultural issues are the root of many problems but there are no universally accepted solutions to dealing with them
Those “who study these things believe that guidelines for cultural behavior are represented in the mind by schemas, knowledge structures that contain the general rules and information necessary for interpreting situations and for guiding behavior.” (pg 128)
Cognitive scientists Roger Schank and Bob Abelson suggest we follow scripts to guide sequence of behavior with sociologist Erving Goffman calling social constraints on acceptable behavior “frames” 
If you violate cultural norms, it makes you and other people uncomfortable 
Cultural constraints are likely to change as time passes on

### Semantic constraints (pg 129)

Semantics is the study of meaning and the constraints are what rely on the meaning of the situation to control what actions you can take
A windshield protects the rider’s face so it has to be in front for example
Relies on knowledge of situation and the world
Extreme sports push boundaries of what we think are meaningful and sensible
New technologies change meaning of things and creative people change how we interact with technology and each other

### Logical constraints (pg 130) 

Logical constraints are used by home dwellers who take repair jobs. If there is one part extra, there was an error
No physical or cultural principles but a logical relationship between spatial or functional layout of components and things they are affected by

### Cultural norms, conventions, and standards (pg 130)

Every culture has its own cultural norms like how there are different forms of greetings
Violation of cultural conventions can completely disrupt an interaction
Conventions are born of cultural constraint with how people behave with some determining what activities should be done and others prohibiting/discouraging actions
Conventions clash sometimes and if you violate conventions, you are marked as a rude outsider

### Applying affordances, signifiers, and constraints to everyday objects (pg 132)

These can simplify our encounters with everyday objects with failure to properly deploy them can lead to problems
Visual indicators of what not to do is a good way of constraining behavior to the proper one
Focusing on aesthetics may blind the designer and user to lack of usability and may even misguide users into doing the wrong action

### The problem with switches (pg 135)

How do you know what switches to press when there are multiple unlabeled switches and they all look identical? 
Basic switches and controls should be simple to design but there are two fundamental difficulties
Determining what type of device it controls 
Mapping problem
The switch problem is only serious if there are multiple of them such as in offices, auditoriums, and industrial locations 
When it is complex with numerous lights, the light controls need to fit the setting such as dimming the lights so the projector shows
The problem is due to difficulties coordinating different professions involved in installing light controls
Lack of clear communication is the most common cause of complicated and confusing designs
Usable design starts with careful observation of how the tasks are being performed with design process finding a way to perform the task well
This is task analysis
Builders and electricians need standardized components and ideally it should be able to account for many situations
“We could have multiple controls for the same item, some in our phones or other portable devices. I can control my home thermostat from anywhere in the world: why can’t I do the same with my lights? Some of the necessary technology does exist today in specialty shops and custom builders, but they will not come into widespread usage until major manufacturers make the necessary components and traditional electricians become comfortable with installing them.” (pg 139)
Good mapping principles could become standard but it will take a long time
New technologies will bring virtues and deficits such as controls being through touch screen but lacking physical affordances like physical switches

### Activity-centered controls (pg 140)

Spatial mapping of switches isn’t always appropriate and in many cases it is better to have switches that controls activities 
Many auditoriums in schools and companies have computer based controls with videos, computers, full lights, and lecture
Lectures require enough lights so note takers can take notes while dark enough for the projector to show
Stage lights are needed so speaker can be seen
When device centered, different control screens are required to do different things, which interrupts the flow to go between different screens
Activity centered controls makes all of the controls in one location
Difficulty is handling cases that weren’t thought about during design
Proper way to go if activities are carefully selected to match actual requirements
Manual controls will still be required for unexpected demands 

### Constraints that force the desired behavior (pg 141) 

Forcing functions are a form of physical constraint so if you fail, it prevents the next step from happening such as needing a key to start the car
Now cars have many ways of whether or not you are allowed to use the car 
As long as authorized people can use the car, everything works fine
