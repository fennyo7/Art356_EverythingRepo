# Chapter 4 Part 2 of DOET

### Constraints that force the desired behavior (pg 141) 

- Forcing functions are a form of physical constraint so if you fail, it prevents the next step from happening such as needing a key to start the car
- Now cars have many ways of whether or not you are allowed to use the car 
- As long as authorized people can use the car, everything works fine
- "Forcing functions are extreme case of strong constraints that can prevent inappropriate behavior." (pg. 142)
- Not every situation needs strong constraints but it can be extended to a variety of situations
- Three methods are interlocks, lock-ins, and lockouts

### Interlocks (pg 142)

- Forces operations to take place in proper sequence
- For example you cannot leave park until you hold the brake pedal

### Lock-ins (pg 143)

- Keeps operation active, preventing someone from prematurely stopping it
- For example if you close something you are working on, there is a prompt urging you to save before closing the tab
- Goal is using design as a business strategy so once people learn the system, they will stay with it and try to keep the status quo
- People using multiple systems gets the middle finger and the one manufacturer's products dominate the scene

### Lockouts (pg 144)

- Lock-in keeps you in a space or prevents action until desired goals have been accomplished while lockouts prevetns someone from entering the space entirely
- If a building is on fire, they prevent people from entering
- Lockouts are used for safety reasons usually

### Conventions, Constraints, and Affordances (pg 145)

- Affordances are potential actions that are possible but easily discoverable only if they are perceivable
- Perceived affordances allows people to determine their possible options
- Conventions helps go from perceiving the affordance to understanding the potential action
- Doorknobs can be grabbed but you have to learn that it is used to open and close doors

### Conventions are cultural constraints (pg 146) 

- "Conventions are a special kind of cultural constraint." (pg 146)
- Different culturals have different eating utensils like some using hands while other using forks
- What is correct and proper in one cultural may be impolite in another
- Conventions are valuable guidance but they can make it hard to change

### When conventions change: The case of destination-control elevators (pg 146)

- "Operating the common elevator seems like a no-brainer. Press the button, get in the box, go up or down, get out. But weâ€™ve been encountering
and documenting an array of curious design variations on this simple
interaction, raising the question: Why? (From Portigal & Norvaisas, 2011.)" (pg 146)
- New convention called "Elevanor Destination Control" where it is considered superior to the usual one but the disadvantage is that it's different
- Back then, there was a human operator who controlled the speed and direction of the elevator to stop at the appropriate floors, open, and shut doors. People go in the elevator and state their floor.
- Automated elevators have buttons to indicate the chosen floor
- Destination control was invented in 1985 but first commercial installation didn't appear until 1990
- As buildings get taller, destination control appears more frequently to privode better service to people

### People's responses to changes in conventions (pg 149)

- People will complain whenever a new way of going something is introduced
- This means they have to learn and common conventions are disrupted
- Metric system is an example as it is superior to the English scale in almost every way but the US, Liberia, and Myanmar refuse to use it
- Change is too upsetting for people who have to learn the new system and the tools to buy the measuring devices are too much
- Consistency is key as it means lessons learned in one thing transfer to another

### The Faucet: A case history of design (pg 150)

- Water faucets are difficult man
- Some sinks needs tapping, others need to be turned, others need pushing, another has motion sensor
- People using faucet only cares about the temperature and the water flow
- Deal with it these ways: 
  - Two controls: Hot and cold water
  - Fixed flow, one control, rotating control turns on water with temperature controlled by knob position
  - Control only amount
  - On and off with fixed temperature and flow: this is motion sensor faucets (eww)
  - Control temperature and flow rate: One control for temperature, other for flow
  - One control for temperature and rate
- Mapping problems for hot and cold faucet controls
  - How to know which one is hot and cold
  - How to change temperature without affecting flow rate
  - How to change flow without affecting temperature
  - Which direction increases water flow
- Mapping problems solved through cultural conventions or constraints
  - Left is hot
  - Right is cold
  - Clockwise tightens (shuts off water)
  - Counterclockwise loosens (turns on water)
  - Doesn't always hold; some don't know about the left and right conventions
- Plumbing designers created the mirror image symmetry in their design
  - Left hand moves clockwise
  - Right hand moves counterclockwise
- It works as long as you always use both hands
- Operation of faucets need to be standardized so the operation is same for all faucets
- Delay and change in temperature take too long
- The guy kinda just goes on a tangent on what should be for faucets (3/10 crashout)
- Many violate principle of desperation: If all else fails, standardize
- If nothing is posbbile, design everything the same way so people only have to learn once
- If you can't do something, develop a cultural constraint and standardize what is kept in the head
- Standards should reflect psychological conceptual models, not physical mechanics
- Standards simplify everything but hinder development

### Using sounds as signifiers (pg 155)

- Not everything can be made visible
- Sounds tell us if things are working or if they need maintenance/repair
- Examples of information provided by sound
  - The click when the bolt on a door slides home
  - Tinny sound when door doesn't shut right
  - Roaring sound when car muffler gets a hole
  - Rattle when things aren't secured
  - Whistle of teakettle when water boils
  - Click when toast pops up
  - Increase in pitch when vacuum gets clogged
  - Change in sound when complex piece of machinery has problems
- A lot of devices beep and burp
- Nautral sounds reflect compelx interaction of natual objects
- Sounds generate when materials interact
- Sound can annoy and distract as easily as it can help
- Absence of sound means absence of knowledge and if feedback is expected from sound, silence can lead to problems

### When silence kills (pg 157)

- Oh boy another story
- Electric cars are very quiet and if they don't make sounds, they can kill
- Greatest danger is when hybrid or electric vehicles move slowly when they are almost completely silent
- Adding sound to warn pedestrians is not new with beeping sounds coming out when vehicles back up
- Some manufacturers think all cars should sound the same with standardized sounds
- Skeuomorphic is technical term for incorporating old familiar ideas into new technology even when it isn't functional
  - Comfortable for traditionalists
  - Technology imitate the old a lot of times for no reason
  - A way to minimize fear of new is to make it look like the old
- When deciding the new vehicle sound, the new sound won which is why the car is almost silent
- Sounds have to meet criteria for vehicles to ensure safety
- Ironic how after so much time to make cars quieter that later we want to add sound to them again
