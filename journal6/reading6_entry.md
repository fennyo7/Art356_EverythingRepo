# Chapter 5 Part 1 of DOET

Chapter 5 of DOET mostly focuses on errors and how society as a whole is flawed when it comes to designing things. In our work culture, we want people to be locked in to working for hours at a time in very boring environments when we are actually creative individuals that crave differentiation. So rather than designing workspaces for humans, we are designing work spaces for machines, which are the ones benefitting from repetition. And when we fail these repetitive tasks, we are the ones getting blamed for it. 

This blame game gets worse with root cause analysis, which is when we investigate until a single cause is found but in reality, situations have multiple causes for multiple events. The five whys help a little in finding the root cause but if people stop too early, then it is really no different than just finding a singular person to blame. 

Because of unrealistic work deadlines, sometimes people need to break the rules in order to get the work done and deliberate violations are proof of that. Since our society values high productivity all the time, there is more likely to be times when our work isn't finished and we have to go overtime. 

There are also two types of errors being slips and mistakes with slips being doing one thing but end up doing another and mistakes being doing something correctly but the wrong plan or goal. He talks a lot about the specifications of slips and mistakes which is not really necessary because errors are still errors at the end of the day and classifying them just seems like a waste of time (he really dragged it out didn't he). 

Overall I just felt like he just repeated mistakes, slips, and errors a lot and I just read those same lines ten thousand times over. It is a sad reality that we live in a society that doesn't allow us to make mistakes but then again that is just the reality of late stage capitalism. :(
