# Chapter 4 Part 2 of DOET

“Knowledge in the world includes perceived affordances and signifiers, the mappings between the parts that appear to be controls or places to manipulate and the resulting actions, and the physical constraints that limit what can be done. Knowledge in the head includes conceptual models; cultural, semantic, and logical constraints on behavior; and analogies between the current situation and previous experiences with other situations.” (pg 123)
Chapter focuses on knowledge of the world, how designers can provide key info that allow people to know what to do even if it is unfamiliar
For example a lego motorcycle has 15 pieces that are constructed well enough that even an adult can put it together. It has physical constraints that limit the ways you can place pieces, leading to effective construction
Combining cultural, semantic, and logical constraints with physical one, it’s possible to build the motorcycle without any instructions or assistance

### Four Kinds of Constraints: Physical, Cultural, Semantic, and Logical (pg 125)
